# NLA-Mixed-Precision-Solvers

This project is named Hybrid-Precision Analysis of CG Solver (H.A.C.S). We want to compare the computation speed and performance (FLOPS) of a Conjugate Gradient (CG) Method using double and mixed computing precision. Additionally, we also want to assess the performance of mixed precision CG Method with OpenMP and OpenACC.
